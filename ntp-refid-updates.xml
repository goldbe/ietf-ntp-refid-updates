    <abstract>
      <t><xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>, section 7.3, "Packet Header
      Variables", defines the value of the REFID, the system peer for the
      responding host.  In the past, for IPv4 associations the IPv4 address
      is used, and for IPv6 associations the first four octets of the MD5
      hash of the IPv6 are used.  There are at least three shortcomings to
      this approach, and this proposal will address the three so noted.  One
      is that knowledge of the system peer is "abusable" information and
      should not be generally available.  The second is that the four octet
      hash of the IPv6 address looks very much like an IPv4 address, and
      this is confusing.  The third is that a growing number of low-stratum
      servers want to offer leap-smeared time to their clients, and there is
      no obvious way to know if a server is offering accurate time or
      leap-smeared time.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="The REFID">
	<t>The interpretation of a REFID is based on the stratum, as
	  documented in <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>, section 7.3,
	  "Packet Header Variables".  The core reason for the REFID in the
	  NTP Protocol is to prevent a degree-one timing loop, where server
	  B decides to follow A as its time source, and A then decides to
	  follow B as its time source.</t>
      
	<t>At Stratum 2+, which will be the case if two servers A and B are
	  exchanging timing information, then if server B follows A as its
	  time source, A's address will be B's REFID.  When A uses IPv4, the
	  default REFID is A's IPv4 address.  When A uses IPv6, the default
	  REFID is a four-octet digest of A's IPv6 address.  Now, if A
	  queries B for its time, then A will learn that B is using A as its
	  time source by observing A's address in the REFID field of the
	  response packet sent by B.  Thus, A will not select B as a
	  potential time source, since this would cause a timing loop.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="NOT-YOU REFID">
	<t>This REFID mechanism, however, also allows a third-party C to
	  learn that A is the time source that is being used by B.  When A
	  is using IPv4, C can learn this by querying B for its time, and
	  observing that the REFID in B's response is the IPv4 address of A.
	  Meanwhile, when A is using IPv6, then C can again query B for its
	  time, and then can use an offline dictionary attack to attempt to
	  determine the IPv6 address that corresponds to the digest value in
	  the response sent by B.  C could construct the necessary
	  dictionary by compiling a list of publically accessible IPv6
	  servers.  Remote attackers can use this technique to attempt to
	  identify the time sources used by a target, and then send spoofed
	  packets to the target or its time source in an attempt to disrupt
	  time service, as was done e.g., in <xref target="NDSS16"></xref>
	  or <xref target="CVE-2015-8138"></xref>.</t>
      
	<t>The REFID thus unnecessarily leaks information about a
	  target's time server to remote attackers.  The best way to
	  mitigate this vulnerability is to decouple the IP address of the
	  time source from the REFID.  To do this, a system can use an
	  otherwise-impossible value for its REFID, called the "not-you"
	  value, when it believes that a querying system is not its time
	  source.</t>

	<t>The NOT-YOU REFID proposal is backwards-compatible.  It can be
	  implemented by one peer in an NTP association without any changes
	  to the other peer.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 REFID">
	<t>In a trusted situation, an operator might well choose to expose
	  the real REFID.  <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>, section
	  7.3, "Packet Header Variables", explains how a remote system peer
	  is converted to a REFID.  It says:
	  <list>
	    <t>If using the IPv4 address family, the identifier is the
	      four-octet IPv4 address.  If using the IPv6 family, it is the
	      first four octets of the MD5 hash of the IPv6 address. ...</t>
	  </list>
	  However, the MD5 hash of an IPv6 address often looks like a valid
	  IPv4 address.  When this happens, an operator cannot tell if the
	  REFID refers to an IPv6 address or and IPv4.  Specifically, the
	  NTP Project has received a report where the generated IPv6 hash
	  decoded to the IPv4 address of a different machine on the system
	  peer's network.</t>

	<t>This proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID for a
	  IPv6 system peer that does not conflict with an IPv4-based
	  REFID.</t>

	<t>This proposal is not fully backwards-compatible. It SHOULD be
	  implemented by both peers in an NTP association.  Having said
	  this, however, in a properly-designed NTP network there is
	  negligible risk of a degree-one timing loop if only one system
	  implements and uses the IPv6 REFID.  This backward incompatability
	  can be avoided by using the proposed I-DO protocol.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Leap-Smear REFID">
	<t><xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref> and earlier versions of
	  NTP are the overwhelming method of distributing time on networks.
	  Leap Seconds will continue to exist for a good number of years'
	  time, and since the timescale mandated by POSIX effectively
	  ignores any instances where there are not 86,400 seconds' time in
	  a day something must be done to reliably synchronize clocks during
	  the application of leap second corrections.  One mechanism for
	  dealing with the application that has recently become visible is
	  to apply the leap second using a "smear", where the time reported
	  by leap-second aware servers is gradually adjusted so there is no
	  major disruption to time synchronization when processing a leap
	  second.</t>

	<t>While the proper handling of leap seconds can be expected from
	  up-to-date software and time servers, there are large numbers of
	  out-of-date software installations and systems that are just not
	  able to properly handle a leap second correction.</t>

	<t>This proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID that
	  indicates that the time being supplied in the NTP packet already
	  contains an amount of leap smear correction, and what that amount
	  is.</t>

	<t>This proposal is backwards-compatible in all but poorly-designed
	  NTP networks.  The entire point of providing NTP servers that
	  offer leap-smeared time in response to CLIENT requests is to
	  provide smooth time to clients that are unable to properly handle
	  leap seconds.  If an operator is skilled enough to provide
	  leap-smeared time to a subset of clients that cannot properly
	  handle leap seconds, they can be expected to know enough to avoid
	  using leap-smeared time between time servers that are expected to
	  be able to properly handle leap seconds.  Leap smears are expected
	  to be implemented on a limited number of time servers where there
	  is a base of client systems that cannot handle a leap second
	  correction.  Furthermore, even in a poorly-designed NTP network
	  the "window of risk" lasts only as long as it takes for the leap
	  second to be smeared.</t>

    <section title="The NOT-YOU REFID">
      <section title="Proposal">
	<t>When enabled, this proposal allows the one-degree loop detection
	  to work and useful diagnostic information to be provided to
	  trusted partners while keeping potentially abusable information
	  from being disclosed to ostensibly uninterested parties.  It does
	  this by returning the normal REFID to queries that come from
	  trusted addresses or from an address that the current system
	  believes is its time source (aka its "system peer"), and otherwise
	  returning a special IP address that is interpreted to mean "not
	  you".  The "not you" IP address is 127.127.127.127 when the query
	  is made from an IPv4 address, or when the query is made from an
	  IPv6 address whose four-octect hash does not equal
	  127.127.127.127.  The "not you" IP address is 127.127.127.128 when
	  the query is made from an address whose four-octect hash equals
	  127.127.127.127.</t>

<!--	<t>Note that this mechanism is transparent to the party that sends
	  timing queries.  A querying system that uses IPv4 continues to
	  check that its IPv4 address does not appear in the REFID before
	  deciding whether to take time from the current system.  A querying
	  system that uses IPv6 continues to check that the four-octet hash
	  of its IPv6 address does not appear in the REFID before deciding
	  whether to take time from the current system.</t>  -->

        <t>Note that this mechanism fully supports degree-one loop detection
          in the case where the responding NOT-YOU system can accurately
          detect when it's getting a request from its system peer, and
          otherwise provides the most basic diagnostic information to third
          parties.</t>

	<t>This proposal will hide the current system's system peer from
	  querying systems that the current system believes are not the
	  current system's system peer.  Note well, however, that the
	  current system will return the "not you" value to a query from its
	  system peer if the system peer sends its query from an unexpected
	  IP address.  Put another way, the responding system has imperfect
	  knowledge about whether or not the sender is its system peer and
	  there are cases where it will offer a NOT-YOU response to its
	  system peer, which will then produce a degree-one timing loop.</t>

    <section title="Augmenting the IPv6 REFID Hash">
      <section title="Background">
	<t>In a trusted network, the S2+ REFID is generated based on the
	  network system peer.  <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>
	  says:</t>

        <t><list><t>If using the IPv4 address family, the identifier is the
	      four-octet IPv4 address.  If using the IPv6 family, it is the
	      first four octets of the MD5 hash of the IPv6 address.
	      ...</t></list></t>

	<t>This means that the IPv4 representation of the IPv6 hash would
	  be: b1.b2.b3.b4 .  The proposal is that the system MAY also use
	  255.b2.b3.b4 as its REFID.  This reduces the risk of ambiguity,
	  since addresses beginning with 255 are "reserved", and thus will
	  not collide with valid IPv4 on the network.</t>

	<t>When using the REFID to check for a timing loop for an IPv6
	  association, if the code that checks the first four-octets of the
	  hash fails to match then the code must check again, using 0xFF as
	  the first octet of the hash.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Potential Problems">
	<t>There is a 1 in 16,777,216 chance that the REFID hashes of two
	  IPv6 addresses will be identical, producing a false-positive loop
	  detection.  With a sufficient number of servers, the risk of this
	  problem becomes a non-issue.  The use of the NOT-YOU REFID and/or
	  the proposed "REFID Suggestion" or "I-DO" extension fields are
	  ways to mitigate this potential situation.</t>

	<t>Unrealistically, if only two instances of NTP are communicating
	  via IPv6 and one side implements this new IPv4 REFID hash and the
	  other side does not, the "other side" will not be able to detect
	  this loop condition.  In this case, the two machines will slowly
	  increase their Stratum until they reach S16 and become
	  unsynchronized.  This situation is considered to be unrealistic
	  because the only current way this could happen would be for there
	  to only be these two instances of NTP available as time sources in
	  a misconfigured "orphan mode" setup.  There is no risk of this
	  happening in an NTP network with 3 or more time sources, or in a
	  properly-configured "time island" setup.
	  <!-- (SHARON: Is this true?  I thought stratum is not used to
	  choose sys peer anymore?)  (HMS: I believe so, as orphan mode
	  systems operate from a fixed stratum, and otherwise root distance
	  increases.) -->

	<t>This format provides coverage for 136 years' time to a precision
	  of 232 picoseconds.  If a leap-second addition is being completely
	  smeared just before before the stroke of the next POSIX second
	  then the smear correction will be (0,1).  If this was the only way
	  to apply a leap smear correction then we could simply use an
	  unsigned value to represent the correction.  But while the first
	  popular leap smear implementation applied the correction over an
	  appropriate number of hours' time before the actual leap second so
	  the system time was corrected at the stroke of 00:00, that meant
	  that the difference between system time and UTC spent half of the
	  duration of the smear application at [.5,1) "off" of correct time.
	  The second popular implementation of the leap smear applied the
	  first half-second correction before the stroke of 00:00 for a
	  correction range of (0,.5] and the last half-second correction
	  starting at the stroke of 00:00 for a [-.5,0) correction range.
	  This also means we need a signed value to represent the amount of
	  correction.</t>

	<t>The REFID of a system that is supplying smeared time to client
	  requests while leap-smear correction is active would be
	  254.b1.b2.b3, where the three octets (b1, b2, and b3) are a 2:22
	  formatted value, yielding precision to 238 nanoseconds, or about a
	  quarter of a microsecond.</t>

	<t>Note that if an NTP server decides to offer smeared time
	  corrections to clients, it SHOULD only offer this time in response
	  to CLIENT time requests.  An NTP server that is offering smeared
	  time SHOULD NOT send smeared time in any peer exchanges.  Also,
	  CLIENT machines SHOULD NOT be distributing time (smeared or
	  otherwise) to other systems.</t>

	<t>We also note that during the application of a leap smear, the
	  REFID from a system offering smeared time cannot provide detection
	  of a timing loop.  This is not expected to be a problem because
	  time server systems are not expected to make CLIENT connections
	  with each other, so they should not be receiving smeared time.
	  Moreso, if a time server is configured to make CLIENT connections
	  to a server that offers smeared time, with the mechanism described
	  here it can detect when it is getting smeared time, and either
	  ignore time from that source, or "undo" the leap smear correction
	  and use the corrected time for that sample.</t>

	<t>This proposal is not an attempt to justify servers offering leap
	  smeared time.  It is only an attempt to make it easy and visible
	  to identify when a server is offering or client is receiving
	  smeared time, and provide the client a means to know the amount of
	  smear correction as of the latest successful poll.</t>

	remote attackers who wish to first learn the address of a target's
	time source, and then attack the target and/or its time source.  As
	such, the "not-you" REFID proposal is designed to harden NTP against
	these attacks by limiting the amount of information leaked in the
	REFID field.  </t>

    <t>Systems running NTP should reveal the identity of their system in
      peer in their REFID only when they are on a trusted network.  The IPv6
      REFID proposal provides one way to do this, when the system peer uses
      addresses in the IPv6 family.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
